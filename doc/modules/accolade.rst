Accolade Support
================

Prerequisite
------------

Accolade SDK v.1.2.26 or later installed.

PF_RING has native support for Accolade adapters, the Accolade library
needs to be installed (under /opt/accolade) in order to enable the 
Accolade module at runtime.

Installation
------------

In order to install the Accolade driver run the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

   tar xvzf SDK_*.tgz
   cd SDK_*
   cd drv; make install; cd ..
   cd lib; make install; cd ..

Then load the driver with:

.. code-block:: console

   echo 1024 > /sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages
   insmod /opt/accolade/driver/anic_mem.ko mbytes_per_device=64
   /opt/accolade/bin/anic_load

If you are running an old firmware and you need to update it, you should
run the following commands: 

.. code-block:: console

   cd SDK_*/tools/
   gunzip fpga_*.rbt.gz
   ./anic_fwupdate --id 0 --script fpga_*.rbt
   reboot

Now you are ready to compile and run PF_RING with Accolade support.
Note that if you are installing pfring from packages, Accolade support
is already enabled.

.. code-block:: console

   cd PF_RING/kernel; make
   sudo insmod pf_ring.ko; cd ..
   cd userland; ./configure
   cd lib; make; cd ..
   cd libpcap; ./configure; make; cd ..
   cd examples; make
   sudo ./pfcount -i anic:0

Please note that:

- in order to open port 0 from adapter 0 you should specify anic:DEV:PORT, example:

.. code-block:: console

   pfcount -i anic:0:0

or just anic:PORT when using the default adapter 0, example:

.. code-block:: console

   pfcount -i anic:0

Opening a port this way, the full card is initialised, causing issues when opening other ports later (previous ports stop working), this can be avoided using the port-to-ring binding as explained later on.
- in order to open ring 0 from adapter 0 you should specify anic:DEV@RING, example:

.. code-block:: console

   pfcount -i anic:0@0

This is usually used in combination with anic_rx_block_mfl which is used to setup the card for multi-process applications. 

Example of ports aggregation and load-balancing to 2 rings:

.. code-block:: console

   anic_rx_block_mfl -i 0 --mode=2 

Example of port-to-ring (ring 0 is port 0) binding:

.. code-block:: console

   anic_rx_block_mfl -i 0 --mode=port

Accolade and Packet Copy
------------------------

If you use the PF_RING (non-ZC) API packets are read in zero-copy. Instead
if you use PF_RING ZC API, a per-packet copy takes place, which is required to move
payload data from Accolade-memory to ZC memory. Keep this in mind!

Hw Filtering
------------

Accolade adapters support packet filtering in hw. In order to set an
hw filter there are two options:

- Using the standard BPF filter: PF_RING thanks to the nBPF library automatically translates BPF filters into hw filters

- Using the pfring_add_hw_rule() API.

Example of setting the default action to 'forward':

.. code-block:: c

   hw_filtering_rule r = {0};
   r.rule_family_type = accolade_default;
   r.rule_family.accolade_rule.action = accolade_forward;
   pfring_add_hw_rule(pd, &r);

Example of setting a filtering rule with 'drop' action for an IPv4 packet we received:

.. code-block:: c

   hw_filtering_rule r = { 0 };
   r.rule_id = rule_id;
   r.rule_family_type = accolade_rule;
   r.rule_family.accolade_rule.action = accolade_drop;
   r.rule_family.accolade_rule.ip_version = h->extended_hdr.parsed_pkt.ip_version;
   r.rule_family.accolade_rule.src_addr_bits = 32;
   r.rule_family.accolade_rule.src_addr.v4 = h->extended_hdr.parsed_pkt.ipv4_src;
   r.rule_family.accolade_rule.protocol = h->extended_hdr.parsed_pkt.l3_proto;
   r.rule_family.accolade_rule.src_port_low = h->extended_hdr.parsed_pkt.l4_src_port;
   pfring_add_hw_rule(pd, &r);

For a full list of supported fields please take a look at the hw_filtering_rule struct.
Please note that the number of rule IDs on most adapters is limited to 32.
Example of removing a filtering rule by id:

.. code-block:: c

   pfring_remove_hw_rule(pd, rule_id);
